/**
* \addtogroup watchdog Watchdog Timer
* \ingroup HardwareDrivers
* \{
*
* This driver manages the hardware watchdog countdown timer. By default the
* watchdog is enabled on a two second timeout. The system must reach the
* lowest priority 'idle' thread once every two seconds in order to kick the
* watchdog. If the system is being held somewhere (e.g. a busy loop in an
* application level event handler), then the idle thread will not be reached
* and the watchdog will trigger a soft reset of the chip.
*
* The timeout period of the watchdog cannot be altered, but the below functions
* allow the watchdog to be disabled (for debug purposes), kicked (reset the two
* two second countdown), or tripped (trigger a soft reset manually).
